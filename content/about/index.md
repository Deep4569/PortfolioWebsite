Hello! I'm Deep, a software developer based in Toronto, ON who enjoys building applications.

Currently I am studying Computer Science at [Ryerson University](https://www.ryerson.ca/). I am very interested in robotics and machine learning.

I am a supporter of the [free and open internet](https://www.eff.org/issues/net-neutrality).

When I'm not in front of my computer, I am probably either listening to [music](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/34nbVSZTGIy4Z7SME0tsTE), skating, longboarding, reading, or sleeping.
