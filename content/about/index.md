Hello! I'm Deep, a software developer located in Toronto, CA who enjoys building applications.

Currently I am studying Computer Science at [Ryerson University](https://www.ryerson.ca/). I am very interested in robotics and machine learning.

I am a supporter of the [free and open internet](https://www.eff.org/issues/net-neutrality) and have recently started my contributions in open-source.

When I'm not in front of my computer, I am probably either listening to music, skating, longboarding, reading, or helping around the house.
